# Approval lists can contain:

# NOTES:
#
# 1. File patterns use Git ignore syntax (see gitignore(5))
#    Example: *.js matches all .js files
#    Example: src/**/*.ts matches all .ts files in src/ directory tree
#
# 2. Patterns are matched in order from top to bottom
#    First matching pattern determines the approvers
#    More specific patterns should come first
#
# 3. If no pattern matches, no owner is assigned
#    Default: No approval required
#
# 4. Wildcards:
#    * matches any file
#    ** matches any directory
#    ? matches any single character
#    [abc] matches any character inside brackets
#
# 5. Comments start with #
#    Blank lines are ignored
