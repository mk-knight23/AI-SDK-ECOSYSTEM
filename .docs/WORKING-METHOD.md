# Working Agreement - Use All Five Ecosystems

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**User Instruction:** Always use all five Claude Code ecosystems for every task

---

## 🎯 Mandate

**Whenever working on tasks, I MUST actively use:**

1. **Claude-Tips** - Efficiency & optimization
2. **affaan-m/everything-claude-code** - Specialized tools & agents
3. **obra/superpowers** - Workflow discipline & methodology
4. **nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max** - Design intelligence & UI/UX
5. **frankbria/ralph-claude-code** - Autonomous AI development loops

---

## 📋 How I'll Work

### **For Every Task:**

#### 1. **Use Superpowers (Automatic Methodology)**
```
- Start with BRAINSTORMING for new features
- Ask clarifying questions before coding
- Create detailed plans before implementing
- Enforce TDD (tests FIRST, always)
- Use systematic debugging for issues
- Follow the writing-plans structure
- Request code review between tasks
```

#### 2. **Leverage ECC (Specialized Expertise)**
```
- Use /plan for implementation planning
- Delegate to architect agent for design
- Use /tdd for test-driven development
- Call /code-review for quality checks
- Use /security-scan before completion
- Leverage specialized agents (python-reviewer, etc.)
- Use /verify for verification loops
```

#### 3. **Apply UI UX Pro Max (Design Intelligence)**
```
- Use 50+ UI styles for visual design
- Apply 97 color palettes for branding
- Use 57 font pairings for typography
- Follow 99 UX guidelines automatically
- Ensure accessibility (CRITICAL priority)
- Apply responsive design patterns
- Use performance optimization rules
- Match tech stack specific patterns
```

#### 4. **Apply Claude-Tips Optimizations (Efficiency)**
```
- Suggest voice dictation for complex instructions
- Use /dx:handoff before long sessions
- Leverage extra token capacity
- Monitor status bar for context
- Use /dx:review-claudemd for improvements
- Apply DX skills for common workflows
```

#### 5. **Use Ralph Loop for Autonomous Iteration (When Appropriate)**
```
- Deploy Ralph Loop for large refactoring tasks
- Use Ralph Loop loops for complex features
- Monitor Ralph Loop progress with ralph-monitor
- Leverage autonomous iteration for continuous improvement
- Cancel loops when complete with /cancel-ralph
- Combine with Superpowers methodology for discipline
```

## 🔄 Combined Workflow

### **Example: Building a New Feature**

1. **User states intent:** "I want to add user authentication to my app"

2. **I activate Superpowers:**
   ```
   - BRAINSTORMING skill triggers
   - Ask: "What type of authentication? OAuth? Email/password?"
   - Present design in chunks for approval
   - Save design document
   ```

3. **I use ECC tools:**
   ```
   - /architect agent designs system architecture
   - /plan creates detailed implementation plan
   - Break into bite-sized tasks (2-5 min each)
   ```

4. **I apply UI UX Pro Max:**
   ```
   - Select appropriate UI style (Glassmorphism, Minimalism, etc.)
   - Choose color palette (SaaS, Healthcare, etc.)
   - Apply font pairings
   - Ensure accessibility (4.5:1 contrast, 44x44px touch targets)
   - Follow responsive design patterns
   - Optimize for performance
   ```

5. **I execute with methodology:**
   ```
   - /tdd enforces write-tests-first
   - Subagents work through tasks
   - /code-review between each task
   - /security-scan before completion
   ```

6. **I use Claude-Tips efficiency:**
   ```
   - Suggest voice dictation (4-5x faster)
   - Use /dx:handoff if session gets long
   - Monitor token usage
   - Apply DX skills where relevant
   ```

7. **I consider Ralph Loop for complex iterations:**
   ```
   - For large features: Deploy Ralph Loop
   - For refactoring: Use autonomous iteration
   - Monitor progress and adjust as needed
   - Cancel when intelligent exit conditions met
   ```

## 💎 Creator Wisdom: Philosophies That Guide Us

Each ecosystem creator shares profound insights about AI-assisted development:

### **Jesse (obra) - Superpowers**
> *"Discipline + Automation = Great AI Development"*

**Philosophy:** The best engineers don't guess - they follow a process. Superpowers encodes great engineering practices into auto-triggering skills. Your AI agent just has Superpowers.

**Key Insight:** Auto-triggering skills mean you never forget best practices. TDD, systematic debugging, code review - they happen automatically.

---

### **Affaan Mustafa - Everything Claude Code**
> *"Production-ready configurations evolved over 10+ months of intensive daily use building real products"*

**Philosophy:** Don't overcomplicate - treat configuration like fine-tuning, not architecture.

**Key Insight:** Token economics matter. Default to Sonnet (~60% cost savings), use Opus only for complex tasks. Keep MCPs under 10 enabled per project.

---

### **nextlevelbuilder - UI/UX Pro Max**
> *"Beautiful UI for everyone, not just designers"*

**Philosophy:** AI should apply design intelligence, not just generate random interfaces. Industry-specific rules prevent anti-patterns (e.g., no AI purple gradients for banking apps).

**Key Insight:** Context-aware design means fintech needs trust blue, healthcare needs calming greens, gaming needs vibrant colors. Design isn't one-size-fits-all.

---

### **Frank Bria - Ralph Loop**
> *"I'm learning that 'good enough' is sometimes the right goal. Ralph doesn't need to be perfect - it needs to be useful."*

**Philosophy:** True autonomy means AI knows when to stop. Dual-condition exit detection: task completion + diminishing returns.

**Key Insight:** Session continuity across context limits is the breakthrough. Ralph preserves state when Claude Code compacts, enabling multi-hour autonomous sessions.

---

### **ykdojo - Claude-Tips**
> *"The best way to get better at using Claude Code is by using it... consume a lot of tokens."*

**Philosophy:** Efficiency isn't just about going faster - it's about working smarter. Voice dictation is 4-5x faster than typing. System prompt slimming saves 10k tokens/session.

**Key Insight:** Whenever you find yourself repeating a task, automate it. Automation of automation is the goal.
